## 1. Introduction

The credit card industry plays a crucial role in shaping consumer financial behavior, offering convenience, access to credit, and a wide range of spending opportunities. However, understanding **how different customer groups use credit cards** is essential for financial institutions aiming to maximize profitability while minimizing risk.

This project, **‚ÄúCustomers‚Äô Behavior on Credit Cards,‚Äù** focuses on analyzing customer spending patterns, demographic influences, and credit card usage characteristics. By examining purchase behaviors, value accumulation, and group-level contributions, the study seeks to uncover which customer segments provide the **highest long-term value (LTV)** and how these insights can inform **retention strategies, targeted marketing campaigns, and product optimization**.

Through this analysis, we aim to:

* Identify high-value customer segments that significantly impact profitability.
* Explore common behavioral and demographic patterns that drive card usage.
* Provide actionable recommendations to prioritize customer groups for marketing and retention.

Ultimately, this project bridges the gap between raw transaction data and strategic decision-making, helping financial institutions create **data-driven, customer-centric strategies** for growth and sustainability.
